# rpyftdio
A monolithic FTDI flasher that will accept hex binary as input and attempt to write to a connected FTDI-compatible device.  This will only be tested on an STM32 for now via the blue-pill dev board, as I realized I don't have an FTDI capable programmer handy and don't want to wait 3 weeks for Amazon to ship one.
